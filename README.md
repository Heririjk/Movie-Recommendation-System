# NLP Movie Recommendation


As a junior Data Analyst, I am pleased to present my project. Throughout the first three days, I encountered an immense workload regarding the cleaning of the data. However, despite the varying formats within the list, I remained motivated and determined to overcome this personal challenge.

Step-by-step, I used Python to develop a movie-recommendation system. By modifying several elements, you can experience the system yourself. Specifically, in code block 24 of Jupyter notebook, you can call the function "give_recommendation("Blue in the Face")". Select any other movie from the list, and you will receive a list of movie-recommendations.

One significant drawback I experienced was that PowerBI is unavailable for Mac. To overcome this, I opted for Tableau as an alternative. Using Tableau, I created a dashboard that aims to help you find more movies tailored to your preference. After selecting a movie, you can determine your style based on the genre and other graphs. For interactivity, hover over the dashboard for more information. The primary filter for the dashboard is the movies displayed within the movie ratings section. When you move over a movie, the dashboard interacts with relevant data shown in relation to the film.

In the data folder, you will find all the data used to complete this project. Similarly, the code folder contains the code in Jupyter format.

TIMELINE:

Regarding the project's timeline, I spent the first two days primarily cleaning the data to ensure the necessary information was available for analysis. This included working with Python dictionaries that contained multiple keys and values. Afterward, I spent three days deepening my knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how it can be applied to the film industry.

Additionally, I completed a DataCamp course that covered several key concepts and techniques relevant to the project. This allowed me to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the project's objectives and helped me to overcome some of the challenges I faced during the project.

The last three days were spent reviewing the project and developing a dashboard in Tableau that accurately represented the movie recommendation system. This was a challenging task, but the end result was a highly interactive and intuitive dashboard that provides useful insights into the user's movie preferences.

Overall, this project took a total of nine days to complete, with each day being crucial to its success.

Thank you for your attention.
