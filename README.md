# Movie Recommendation System


As a junior Data Analyst, I am pleased to present my project's ReadMe. Throughout the first three days, I encountered an immense workload regarding the cleaning of the data. However, despite the varying formats within the list, I remained motivated and determined to overcome this personal challenge.

Step-by-step, I used Python to develop a movie-recommendation system. By modifying several elements, you can experience the system yourself. Specifically, in code block 24 of Jupyter notebook, you can call the function "give_recommendation("Blue in the Face")". Select any other movie from the list, and you will receive a list of movie-recommendations.

One significant drawback I experienced was that PowerBI is unavailable for Mac. To overcome this, I opted for Tableau as an alternative. Using Tableau, I created a dashboard that aims to help you find more movies tailored to your preference. After selecting a movie, you can determine your style based on the genre and other graphs. For interactivity, hover over the dashboard for more information. The primary filter for the dashboard is the movies displayed within the movie ratings section. When you move over a movie, the dashboard interacts with relevant data shown in relation to the film.

In the data folder, you will find all the data used to complete this project. Similarly, the code folder contains the code in Jupyter format.

Finally, feel free to browse my contact folder if you are interested in collaboration. I am open to any suggestions or feedback.

Thank you for your attention.
